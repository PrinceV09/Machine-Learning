# What are Tensors?
A Tensor is a generalized mathematical object used to store data in multiple dimensions.
A Tensor is an N-dimensional array of numbers.

| Name | Example | Dimension |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 0D / Scalar | `5` | 0D |
| 1D / Vector | `[1, 2, 3]` | 1D |
| 2D / Matrix | `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` | 2D |
| ND / Tensor | 3D, 4D, ... arrays | ≥ 3D |

The rank of a tensor = Number of dimensions = Number of axes
1D Tensor is also known as vector and according to the above example the Vector has 3 Dimensions because the Vector contains 3 values.
