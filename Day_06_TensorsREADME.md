# What are Tensors?
A Tensor is a generalized mathematical object used to store data in multiple dimensions.
A Tensor is an N-dimensional array of numbers.

  0D/scalar                                                   5                                                0D
  1D/Vector                                                [1,2,3]                                             1D
  2D/Matrix                                            [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]                                       2D
  ND/Tensor                                               3D,4D,..., arrays                                    >=3D

The rank of a tensor = Number of dimensions = Number of axes
1D Tensor is also known as vector and according to the above example the Vector has 3 Dimensions because the Vector contains 3 values.
