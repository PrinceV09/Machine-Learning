**What is Feature Scaling?**<br>
Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range.

**Why do we need Feature Scaling?**<br>
Feature Scaling is used to bring all input features to a similar range so that Machine Learning algorithms behave correctly and efficiently.
