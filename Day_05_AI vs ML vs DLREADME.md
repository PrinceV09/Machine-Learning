# **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

Artificial Intelligence is the broad field focused on building machines that can simulate human intelligence such as reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving.

Examples: Chatbots, Game-playing systems, Recommendation engines.

# **Machine Learning (ML)**

Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

Examples: Spam email detection, Price prediction, Movie recommendations.

# Deep Learning (DL)**

Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers to learn complex patterns automatically.

Examples: Face recognition, Speech recognition, Autonomous vehicles.
