### Types of Machine Learning (Based on learning approach)

1. Offline Learning

- Offline learning is a machine learning approach where a model is trained using a fixed dataset all at once, and no learning happens after deployment unless the model      is retrained manually.
   Offline learning is also known as Batch learning.

2. Online Learning

- Online learning is a machine learning approach where a model learns continously by updating itself incrementally as new data arrives, without retraining from scratch.

3. Instance Based Learning

- Instance-Based learning is a machine learning approach where predictions are made by comparing new instances with stored training examples rather than using a learning    model.

4. Model Based Learning

- Model Based learning is a machine learning approach where the system learns a mathematical model (rules or patterns) from training data and then uses that model to        make predictions, instead of storing all examples.
