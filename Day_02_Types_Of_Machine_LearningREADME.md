# Types of Machine Learning 
Machine Learning can be broadly classified into different types based on how the model learns from data.

### Supervised Learning 
Supervised Learning is a Machine Learning technique in which a model learns a mapping from input data to known output labels and uses it to make predictions on new data.
1. Regression
2. Classification

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is a Machine Learning technique in which a model identifies hidden patterns, structures or relationships in data without labeled outputs.
1. Clustering
2. Dimensionality Reduction
3. Anamoly Detection
4. Association

### Semi-supervised Learning
Semi-supervised learning is a Machine Learning technique where a model is trained using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a learning techinque in which an agent learns optimal actions through trials and error by maximizing cumulative reward.
